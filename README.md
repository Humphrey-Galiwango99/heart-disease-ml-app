Heart Disease Risk Prediction (Uganda)  This project is my Refactory 2025 Capstone, demonstrating the end-to-end data science pipeline: Data → Cleaning → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment.  We use patient health indicators (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, lifestyle habits) to predict the risk of heart disease.
